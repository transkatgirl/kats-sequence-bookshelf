## Contents

[Kat's Bookshelf](https://github.com/transkatgirl/kats-bookshelf/#readme) is a small, hand-curated collection of courses which will slowly grow over time. This is an offshoot of the primary bookshelf, with the goal of providing an offline version of [LessWrong's Library](https://www.lesswrong.com/library).

All courses included in the bookshelf are made using free, open-access publications. Links to the original writings are included in each courseâ€™s description.

If you would like to suggest improvements to the collection (such as book recommendations), please [file an issue](https://github.com/transkatgirl/kats-sequence-bookshelf/issues).

### Included Writings

The following books are included in this bookshelf:

- [Rationality: From AI To Zombies](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/rationality:-from-ai-to-zombies) by Eliezer Yudkowsky

Additional books in this category will be added in the future.
